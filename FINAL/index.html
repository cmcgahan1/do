    <p>  Is College Sports now a Pay to Win enviornment? With the increase of money directed toward college sports programs fans, alumni, and students are committed to doing whatever they can to see their team win. Now, each university receives more money from donors, boosters, and in their endowment to use to improve their sports teams and various atheltics programs. </p> 
        <p> However, not all universities are capable of spending tens of millions of dollars towards their athletics programs. There is a clear imbalance between Power 4 schools and Group of 5 programs when it comes to financial spending. </p> 
        
        <p> Across the country, if you were to ask anyone on a college campus what sports team receives the most funding, there is a good chance they would answer football. If that was their hypothesis they would be right. Football runs the show when it comes to college athletic finances. </p>

        <p> One of the most historic college football programs, the University of Alabama, spent over 80 million dollars for their team last season. Their entire football operating expenses, including the cost of athletics student aid from 2020-2023 was 279 million dollars. </p>
        <p> In comparison to their entire athletic expenses of Alabamaâ€™s athletic department ranging north of 750 million dollars, over 37% of their budget was directed towards their football team. </p>
        <p> Athletic programs have also focused on paying large sums of money to improve their coaching staff. In 2023, at the Power Five conferences, the sum of their total football coaching salaries was over 2.6 billion dollars. The school with the lowest football spending out of public FBS schools from 2020-2023, the University of Idaho, still spent 23 million dollars on their football team. </p>
        <p>Even with having the lowest spending out of all FBS, their football expenses were still 28% of their entire budget. As college athletics continue to receive more money, football staff and programs will continue to grow and become more expensive.  </p>
       
        <p> In college athletics, the Power Five conferences usually dominate. The SEC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac 12, and the ACC are the premiere conferences in Division I sports. However, the strength could be related to the uneven playing field that they compete on. </p>

        <p> In 2023, the SEC conference totaled 808 million dollars on their coaching salaries. In comparison, the Mid-American conference totaled just under 121 million dollars. That is nearly a 700 million dollar difference in conference spending.  </p>
        <p> This trend continues in every financial category.The total expenses in 2023 in the Power 5 conference averaged roughly 5.5 million dollars per year. But the Group of Five (Mountain West, Conference USA, American Atheltic, Mid-American, and Sun-Belt conference) averaged 1.7 million dollars in expenses. Once again, the data displays how power five schools are at a financial advantage against the entire country when it comes to spending.  </p> </p>

       <p>  Above the chart displays the top five programs with highest expenses related to their total football spending salaries. Once again, the major schools with numerous donors and booster clubs help create payrolls for coaching staff that reach over 70 million dollars. The top conference in college football, Southeastern conference, has three programs in the top five and four in the top ten. But does the programs who have the most money always win on the field? Not exactly. </p> 
        <iframe title="Top five and bottom five total football spending programs" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-A2TnI" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/A2TnI/7/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="479" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();

  <p> Just because a team has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on their football program, does not mean they will win every game on the schedule. The chart shows the top and bottom five schools with the most and least amount of money spent on their football program. Aurburn has spent nearly 200 millions dollars more on their football team and has won less games in the past four years than Army and Idaho, whose total football spending combined is under 42 million dollars. But at the top, things stay the same. Alabama and Ohio State invest the most money into their teams and see the results of winning seasons and national championships. However, the strength could be related to the uneven playing field that they compete on. In 2023, the SEC conference totaled 808 million dollars on their coaching salaries. In comparison, the Mid-American conference totaled just under 121 million dollars. That is nearly a 700 million dollar difference in conference spending. This trend continues in every financial category.The total expenses in 2023 in the Power 5 conference averaged roughly 5.5 million dollars per year. But the Group of Five (Mountain West, Conference USA, American Atheltic, Mid-American, and Sun-Belt conference) averaged 1.7 million dollars in expenses. The data displays how power five schools are at a financial advantage against the entire country when it comes to spending.  </p> </p> 

<p> The data analyzed in this paper and pivot tables made came from the Knight-Newhouse College Athletic Database. The data only displays FBS public schools with financial models from 2020-2023 released in Janurary 2024. It does not include any Name Image and Likeness deals. </p>
